This is the additional resources collection for the Technical Animation In Video Games book, consisting of Python tools and corrective joint examples for Maya.
The files are tested to work on Maya 2022 and later.

All included scripts have drag & drop functionality; merely drag & drop them into your Maya viewport to execute them.
Alternatively, inside each script you will find the appropiate functions you can copy onto your Maya shelf, or into the script editor.

Tools -
ML_clean_channel_box_connections - This tool will hide all inputs/outputs on the selected nodes via the isHistoricallyInteresting attribute been set to False.
ML_colour_marker - This tool will allow you to choose & apply custom colours to viewport and outliner nodes.
ML_copy_paste_world_transforms - This tool will allow you to copy and paste the world space transforms of a node 
ML_move_skinned_joints_mode - This tool will enable/disable the Move Skinned Joints mode, allowing you to move skinned joints without moving their associated skinned geometry.
ML_set_joint_labels - This tool will automatically detect and set the Joint Labels attributes for all joints in the scene.
ML_shape_copier - This tool will allow you to copy shapes from multiple selected nodes and apply them to the last selected.

Maya_Twist_Examples -
SK_Forearm_Twist_01_Connection - Beginner solution for a twist through a direct connection with some gimbal pitfalls.
SK_Forearm_Twist_02_Aim - Intermediate solution for a twist through an aim constraint with some gimbal pitfalls.
SK_Forearm_Twist_03_Aim_Alt - Alternate solution for a twist through an aim constraint
SK_Forearm_Twist_04_Matrices - Advanced matrices solution for a twist.
